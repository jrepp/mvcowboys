<p><strong>We want to celebrate our athletes for their performances during the week. We agree that football is a team sport and that it requires the efforts of everyone on the team. However, we still want to acknowledge some players for their individual contributions and efforts.   If you see them walking around, make sure you give them an extra pat on the back. </strong></p>

MVP - Defensive Line<br />
<strong>Evan Connell</strong><br />
Evan helped his team notch another victory by shutting down the opponent and did not let them run the ball through his Gap on Defense. Using the techniques he's learned throughout the season, Evan made himself difficult to block during the game.</p>

MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Talan Doherty </strong><br />
No team can be successful without an offensive line that can block. Part of the reason for the Cowboy's success and undefeated season is because of the contributions made by Talan. Talan controlled his defender the entire game and did not allow him to get into the backfield on any of the Cowboys offensive plays.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3380" alt="TM_Christian Alvarado" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tm_christian-alvarado.jpg" width="75" height="99" /><br />
MVP - Defensive Skill Group (LB, FS, CB)<br />
<strong>Christian Alvarado</strong><br />
As the days and weeks go past Christian is becoming a more confident football player, who is earning more and more time on the field each week. His efforts on defense allowed the Cowboys to shutout their opponent, and improve their record to 5 wins and 0 losses.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3381" alt="TM_Damon Goodin" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tm_damon-goodin.jpg" width="75" height="96" /><br />
MVP - Offensive Skill Group (QB, WR, RB)<br />
<strong>Damon Goodin</strong><br />
Damon is a 1st year player who continues to contribute to the success of the Cowboy's potent running game. Damon is often tasked with making the most challenging blocks on the field, and is winning those battles. Each week that passes, Damon is gaining more experience to help his team as they start ramping up for their playoff run.</p>

<strong>Jackson Brady</strong><br />
The Cowboys were able to score at will on Saturday against the Eagle's defense. A large part of that was due to Jackson Brady's blocking on the outside defenders. Late in the game Jackson was given the opportunity to run the ball, and he did not disappoint. Jackson finished the day with a rushing average of approx. 30 yards per carry.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3334" alt="MM_JelaniEverette2" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_jelanieverette2.jpg" width="75" height="121" />MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong></strong><strong>Jelani Everette</strong><br />
Jelani accepted the coach's challenge this week to block to the echo of the whistle, and was a dominate force on the offensive line. Jelani controlled his defender the entire game and did not allow him to make a single tackle. Jelani's efforts helped the Cowboys come away with another victory.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3335" alt="MM_NicholasJohnson" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_nicholasjohnson.jpg" width="75" height="104" />MVP - Defensive Line<br />
<strong>Nicholas Johnson</strong><br />
Nicholas simply played on a higher level on Saturday. No matter where he lined up, the Eagle offense had no one that could block Nicholas, who made several tackles in the backfield. His efforts and hits on the ball carrier ignited the rest of the Cowboy defense, who responded with another shutout.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3336" alt="MM_SamBurlison" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_samburlison.jpg" width="75" height="121" /></p>
<p>MVP - Defensive Skill Group (LB, CB, FS)<br />
<strong>Sam Burlison</strong><br />
Each week Sam's confidence and technique has steadily improved. Sam continues to work hard and is becoming a solid defensive back, who excels at open field tackling. The Eagle's offense was held in check and out of the end-zone because of Sam's ability to single handedly bring down the ball carrier.</p>
