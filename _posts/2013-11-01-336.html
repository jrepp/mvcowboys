<p>There are other organizations in our area that provide Youth Football to our community. However we strongly believe that <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">we are the #1 program around</span>!!</span> While other organizations continue to try and knock us down, we will be honest and truthful as why we believe we are the top program in our area.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2959" alt="Icon_CowboyStar" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/icon_cowboystar4.jpg" width="470" height="382" /></p>
<p>1. <strong>Weight</strong> – Our weights are very competitive against other leagues. Unlike other leagues, we do not give a 1 lb. or 1 ½ lb.  per week weight allowance that will be added at weigh-in before each game.  The weights stay the same all season. We front load our weight scale. Meaning, our weights are just about the same if not equal to, other organizations as the season progresses. It's not safe for kids to lose too much weight to play in a certain division. Safety of this kind is a concern at AYF.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Age Appropriate</strong> – We do not have the older/lighter rule. We try and match children up accordingly to their age and maturity. For example, we do not think it is fair for an 8 year old child to go up against an 11 year child. Even though the 11 year may weigh less than the 8 year old, the 11 year old is more mature and more physically sound than the 8 year old. And further more, if the 11 year old turns 12 during the season, that child has an even bigger advantage on the 8 year old. To us, that is a very big safety concern.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Competition</strong> – We not only compete locally, we also compete nationally. Each year, in all of the AYF, 150 football teams compete for a title. But only the best, the top team from each region, in each division, will qualify for the National Championships in Kissimmee, Florida. Also, most of our teams go and play bowl games at the end of the season in other parts of the country including Arizona, Las Vegas, Hawaii, etc…</p>
<p>4.<strong> Scholastics </strong>- AYF is committed to promoting the importance of education and scholastic achievement to all members through its entire program. All participants must have passing grades in order to participate. AYF has several academic programs, from tutoring to essay contests and scholarship awards. AYF annually celebrate the nations’ top scholar athletes.</p>
<p>5. <strong>NFL Partner</strong> - We are <strong>PROUD</strong> to be a part of the largest football community in the world! American Youth Football (AYF) is <strong>OFFICIALLY</strong> the largest youth football organization in the world! A National Youth Partner of the <strong>NFL</strong>, AYF provides support services, scholarships, grants, "Giving Back" programs and tournaments to over 500,000 members.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Travel </strong>– We have heard<strong> </strong>from other organizations that we travel too much. But we really don’t. The majority of our games are played at home. Yes, we can travel as far as Santa Monica to play a game. Unlike other organizations, we travel for the most part as a chapter. Not as an individual team. So that helps with families who have children in different divisions to be in one place instead of all over L.A. and Orange County.</p>
<p>We also believe that our children are very fortunate to live in South Orange County. We sometimes travel to a few chapters who are less fortunate than ours. Hopefully, our children and our parents are able to realize how fortunate they are. And that it opens their eyes of how big this world really is.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Equipment</strong> – We provide everything you need <strong>except</strong> cleats and a jock strap. Some other organizations require that you purchase required items before your child can step on the field.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Background Checks </strong>- Failure to act in a safe and responsible manner with children entrusted to your care can mean severe disciplinary action taken against you. For that, AYF has partnered with LexisNexis to make sure no coach or instructor goes unchecked and that we are able to provide the best and safest working environment for our members.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Matching kids with teams</strong> – With the Cowboys, the majority of our players stay with the same coach and players each season. This builds unity, friendships, and a strong bond within the team and its families. This is why we believe that we are more than just a youth program that provides football. But a youth program that provides a family.</p>
