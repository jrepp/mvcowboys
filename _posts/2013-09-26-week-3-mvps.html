<p><strong>We want to celebrate our athletes for their performances during the week. We agree that football is a team sport and that it requires the efforts of everyone on the team. However, we still want to acknowledge some players for their individual contributions and efforts.   If you see them walking around, make sure you give them an extra pat on the back. </strong></p>

<p>MVP - Defensive Line<br />
<strong>Anthony Saldana -</strong> AKA "<em>BEAST MODE</em>"<br />
It was easy to spot Anthony on the football field, since he was the most aggressive player on the field. On Offense Anthony scored his first Touchdown of the season, and on Defense he was in the backfield just about every play stopping the other team from scoring.</p>

<p>MVP - Offensive Skill Group (RB, QB, WR)<br />
<strong>Caleb Anaya</strong> - AKA "<em>Speed Racer</em>"-<br />
Caleb also reached the endzone during week 3, scoring his first Touchdown of the season. Caleb helped seal the victory for the Cowboys with his aggressive play and the number of flags that he pulled.</p>

<p>MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Joshua Haney</strong><br />
As a result of Joshua's hard work, he was able to play multiple positions (Tackle, Center, Running back, and Defensive line) during the game. The running game was able to be successful because of Joshua's discipline to remember the snap count, and his toughness to dominate the defender in front of him.</p>

<p>MVP - Defensive Skill Group (LB, CB, FS)<br />
<strong>Xavier Lopez</strong>-  AKA "<em>X</em>"<br />
With Xavier's outstanding defensive coverage, he was clearly the defensive leader during Saturday's contest.  X was able to completely shut down the run game and keep everything inside, to keep the opponent from scoring more than 6 points</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000080;">Tiny Mite</span></strong></h1>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3260" alt="TM_BostonBadraun" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/tm_bostonbadraun.jpg" width="75" height="99" /></p>
<p>MVP - Offensive Skill Group (QB, RB, WR)<br />
<strong>Boston Badraun</strong><br />
Boston played fullback and was tasked to block the best player on the other team the entire game. Not only did Boston block them, he dominated them including a few blocks where he put the defender on their back. As a result of Boston's efforts, the running backs had huge holes to run through.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3261" alt="TM_DominickHo" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/tm_dominickho.jpg" width="75" height="99" /></p>
<p>MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Dominick Ho</strong><br />
Dominick was a force on the offensive line, and made running the ball easy on Saturday. Even though the Demos tried to blitz on Dominick's side of the line, he controlled the blitzing player(s) and put several of them on their backs.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3262" alt="TM_JaidenAllain" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/tm_jaidenallain.jpg" width="75" height="99" /></p>
<p>MVP - Defensive Line<br />
<strong>Jaiden Allain</strong><br />
Although this is Jaiden's first year playing football, he didn't play like that during week 3. The coaches have enough confidence in Jaiden to have him play 2 important positions on the defensive side of the ball: Outside linebacker and Defensive End. While playing those positions Jaiden stopped the Demos from running outside, and made several tackles during the game.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3263" alt="TM_NatePiatek" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/tm_natepiatek.jpg" width="75" height="99" /></p>
<p>MVP - Defensive Skill Group (LB, CB, FS)<br />
<strong>Nate Piatek</strong><br />
Nate continues to work at his position(s) , as he steadily gains confidence and improves each week. As a result of his efforts, Nate was able to make a few critical touchdown saving tackles during the game on Saturday.  His key tackles helped the Cowboys remain undefeated this season.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000080;">Mighty Mite</span></strong></h1>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3269" alt="MM_DiegoLopez" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mm_diegolopez1.jpg" width="75" height="99" />MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Diego Lopez</strong><br />
Diego continues to improve each week and is steadily becoming a consistent blocker on the offensive line for the Cowboys. Often tasked with blocking the other teams most athletic player(s), Diego always rises to the challenge. As a result of Diego's efforts the Cowboys were able to dominate the time of possession and only allowed their opponent to run <strong>5</strong> offensive plays.......<em>the entire second half of the game</em>. 1 of those 5 plays included a fumble that the Cowboys went on to recover.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3270" alt="MM_IanGrogan" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mm_iangrogan.jpg" width="75" height="99" />MVP - Offensive Skill Group (QB, RB, WR)<br />
<strong>Ian Grogan</strong><br />
With recent injuries in the Cowboy backfield, Ian picked a good time to take his running skills to the next level. Ian ran with speed, determination, and power on Saturday, and could only be taken down by multiple defenders. Ian also played with a chip on his shoulder on the defensive side of the ball, where he made several big hits on the other team's ball carrier.</p>
