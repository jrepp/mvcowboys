<h2><span style="color:#808080;">To the 9/11 heroes who gave their lives at the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and Pennsylvania, may you sleep soundly. As you look down lovingly at your family and friends, know that you are missed but not forgotten. To the surviving heroes, may the painful memories of the day ease with the knowledge that America supports you and your bravery. While our country recognizes and honors the anniversary of the September 11th tragedy, please know in your heart that all American citizens celebrate your bravery as we walk in freedom</span></h2>
