<p><strong>We want to celebrate our athletes for their performances during the week. We agree that football is a team sport and that it requires the efforts of everyone on the team. However, we still want to acknowledge some players for their individual contributions and efforts.   If you see them walking around, make sure you give them an extra pat on the back. </strong></p>

<p>MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Anthony Saldana -</strong> AKA "<em>BEAST MODE</em>"<br />
Anthony was assigned to block the Eagles #1 player the entire game. Anthony's efforts contributed to the win by not allowing the other team's best player to stop the Cowboy offense from scoring.</p>

<p>MVP - Offensive Skill Group (RB, QB, WR)<br />
<strong>Xavier Lopez</strong>-  AKA "<em>X</em>"<br />
Xavier ran the ball extremely well during week 4. As we reach the midway point of the season, X continues to get better after having just played his best game of the year.<br />

<strong>Diego Dominguez</strong>- AKA "<em>Dingo</em>"<br />
Diego was a key factor in helping the Cowboys come away with another victory. His efforts on Defense prevented a number of Eagle plays from reaching the end-zone. On offense, Diego's speed and agility proved to be a big challenge for the Eagle defenders.</p>

<strong>Justin Camacho</strong><br />
Justin is a first year player who contributed to his team's victory with his blocking, and making huge holes for the running back. Without Justin's play on Saturday, the Cowboys would not have come away with a win.</p>

<strong>Daniel McKeown</strong><br />
Daniel played lights out on Saturday and made his presence known on the field. Daniel contributed to his teams success by making several tackles on the ball carrier, and by earning himself a quarterback sack.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3328 alignright" alt="TM_GavinBlum" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tm_gavinblum.jpg" width="75" height="97" />MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Gavin Blum</strong><br />
The Cowboy running game continues to be effective because of the blocking of the offensive line. Leading the way this week was Gavin Blum who made several key blocks to open large holes for the running backs to run through.</p>

<strong>Gavin Madrid</strong><br />
Gavin showed his versatility this weekend by playing both Cornerback and Linebacker for the Cowboys. Gavin led the defensive unit and made several tackles during the game. His efforts on defense contributed to another shutout by the Cowboys' defense.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3330 alignright" alt="TM_NathanielSerrano" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tm_nathanielserrano.jpg" width="75" height="98" />MVP - Offensive Skill Group (QB, WR, RB)<br />
<strong>Nathaniel Serrano</strong><br />
Nathaniel continues to grow as an offensive weapon for his team. As he grows in confidence, the Coaches look for new ways to get Nathaniel the ball. Saturday we witnessed Nathaniel running through the Eagle defense, and catching a touchdown pass.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000080;">Mighty Mite</span></strong></h1>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3333" alt="MM_JacksonBrady" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_jacksonbrady.jpg" width="75" height="121" />MVP - Offensive Skill Group (QB, WR, RB)<br />
<strong>Jackson Brady</strong><br />
The Cowboys were able to score at will on Saturday against the Eagle's defense. A large part of that was due to Jackson Brady's blocking on the outside defenders. Late in the game Jackson was given the opportunity to run the ball, and he did not disappoint. Jackson finished the day with a rushing average of approx. 30 yards per carry.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3334" alt="MM_JelaniEverette2" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_jelanieverette2.jpg" width="75" height="121" />MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong></strong><strong>Jelani Everette</strong><br />
Jelani accepted the coach's challenge this week to block to the echo of the whistle, and was a dominate force on the offensive line. Jelani controlled his defender the entire game and did not allow him to make a single tackle. Jelani's efforts helped the Cowboys come away with another victory.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3335" alt="MM_NicholasJohnson" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_nicholasjohnson.jpg" width="75" height="104" />MVP - Defensive Line<br />
<strong>Nicholas Johnson</strong><br />
Nicholas simply played on a higher level on Saturday. No matter where he lined up, the Eagle offense had no one that could block Nicholas, who made several tackles in the backfield. His efforts and hits on the ball carrier ignited the rest of the Cowboy defense, who responded with another shutout.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3336" alt="MM_SamBurlison" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_samburlison.jpg" width="75" height="121" /></p>
<p>MVP - Defensive Skill Group (LB, CB, FS)<br />
<strong>Sam Burlison</strong><br />
Each week Sam's confidence and technique has steadily improved. Sam continues to work hard and is becoming a solid defensive back, who excels at open field tackling. The Eagle's offense was held in check and out of the end-zone because of Sam's ability to single handedly bring down the ball carrier.</p>
