<p>• Weight Room &amp; Speed Training<br />
• Football Education/Chalk Talk<br />
• Football Execution/On-field training</p>
<p>Weight Room: The athletes will be under the direction and supervision of a professional trainer and staff to ensure proper technique is taught to provide a safe lifting environment for all. The athlete will improve in core muscle group strength by focusing on the core Olympic lifts of Bench Press, Squat and Power Clean.</p>
<p>Strength improvement will be recorded at the end of each 4-week session. The speed training will be conducted by the varsity staff. Emphasis will be on form and technique to increase 40 yard and Pro-Shuttle Times.</p>
<p>Football Execution/Chalk Talk: The athletes will be instructed by varsity coaches and will be introduced to offensive and defensive schemes that will be used at the high school level. The chalk talk will also include video cuts from high school, college and professional football to show actual players executing the schemes.</p>
<p>Football Execution/On-field Training: The practice plan will be structured to simulate an actual high school practice. Individual and team drills will be used to improve the athletes’ football skills and techniques specific to the position played. Competitive situations will be structured to allow athletes to work against an opponent for skill improvement.</p>
<p>A Team BBQ will be held at the end of the camp April 26th. All athletes in attendance and their families are invited to attend. If you have any questions, please send emails to: Bobjohnson11@cox.net.</p>
