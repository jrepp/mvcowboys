<p>Once again we kicked off the 2013 Football season with a full schedule of exciting events for all of our young Cowboys and their families!! Most Organizations end with the actual Opening Day ceremony, but for da' Cowboys<strong>.........<em>that was just the beginning of it all!!</em></strong> Through the contributions of many, we were able to enjoy our first ever Opening Day <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>Weekend</strong> </em></span>celebration this year.</p>
<p>On Saturday (8/24) we held the <a href="http://wp.me/P2Koar-DM/#openingday">Opening Day ceremony</a> and enjoyed watching all of the Cheer performances as each Cowboy team successfully defended their home turf at Mission High School. On the next morning (8/25) approx. 18 families from the Mighty Mite team were awoken only to discover that their son had been kidnapped from their beds before the sun was up. This would be one of the scariest moments in a parent's life, however in this case no one panic. The team was being "<em>kidnapped"</em> and taken out to a surprise team breakfast. The Authorities were not notified, and each child was safely returned to their home; <em>actually the parents did provide consent.</em> After all the hard-work, it was finally time to relax and recharge. As a token of appreciation for our families, the MV Chapter also hosted a <a href="http://wp.me/P2Koar-D8/#bonfire">Beach Bonfire</a> at Doheny State Beach on Sunday (8/25). Out of this event came the <span style="color:#000080;"><strong><a href="#Washer">1st ever self proclaimed MV Cowboys Washer Pitching Champions*</a></strong></span></p>
