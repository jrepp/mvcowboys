<p><strong>We want to celebrate our athletes for their performances during the week. We agree that football is a team sport and that it requires the efforts of everyone on the team. However, we still want to acknowledge some players for their individual contributions and efforts.   If you see them walking around, make sure you give them an extra pat on the back. </strong></p>

<strong>Caleb Anaya</strong> - AKA  "<em>Speed Racer</em>"<br />
Although his opponent may have been slightly bigger than Caleb, he never once backed down. Whatever his assignment was, Caleb played as hard as he could and showed no fear on the field</p>

<strong>Dryden Knight </strong> - AKA  "<em>Bone Crusher</em>"<br />
In Week 2 we saw Dryden play with a lot of heart and courage and never give up. Dryden also handled one of the most important duties during the game and made sure the center snaps were perfect so the Cowboys could run their plays.</p>

<strong>Joshua Bates</strong> - AKA  "<em>HULK</em>"<br />
At times Lawndale found it difficult to move the ball on offense because Joshua stopped the play before it could get started. With Joshua on the defensive line, the offense could not block him, and he disrupted a   number of plays before the team could reach the line of scrimmage.</p>

<strong>Maxwell Ferranto</strong><br />
Maxwell proved to be a dominate force on defense and did not allow the Lawndale Cardinals to run the ball to the outside while he played Defensive End. He completely shut down the outside running game during week 2.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3189 alignright" alt="TM_NathanielSerrano" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/tm_nathanielserrano.jpg" width="70" height="71" />MVP Offensive Skill Group (QB, RB, WR)<br />
<strong>Nathaniel Serrano</strong> - AKA <em>"Zero"</em><br />
Nathaniel has steadily improved during the season and was able to fill in as Running back during week 2. Although it was his first game in that position, Nathaniel's running ability and vision allowed the cowboys to  move the ball at will through the Lawndale defense.<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-3188 alignright" alt="TM_JaxsonGilles" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/tm_jaxsongilles.jpg" width="70" height="67" /><br />
MVP Defensive Skill Group (LB, CB, FS)<br />
<strong>Jaxon Gilles</strong><br />
Defensively Jaxon Gilles found himself constantly around the ball on Saturday. His hustle, and desire to never give up on plays is what helped him make several Touchdown saving tackles, and kept Lawndale out of the endzone.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3187 alignright" alt="TM_ChrisWilliams" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/tm_chriswilliams.jpg" width="67" height="69" />MVP Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Chris Williams</strong><br />
Chris found himself under a lot of pressure as the Lawndale Cardinals attempted to constantly blitz the Cowboys center; sometimes blitzing 3 players in Chris' gaps. Chris was able stop the defense from getting into the backfield, while never delivering a bad snap to his quarterback.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000080;">Mighty Mite</span></strong></h1>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3192" alt="MM_DiegoLopez" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mm_diegolopez.jpg" width="65" height="85" />MVP Offensive Skill Group (QB, WR, RB)<br />
<strong>Diego Lopez</strong><br />
Diego had a coming out party on Saturday in which he was the recipient of not 1, but 2 Touchdown passes. His ability to block the Outside Linebacker also opened up huge running holes for the Cowboy offense, who  could move the ball at will.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3193" alt="MM_MarcusMendoza" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mm_marcusmendoza.jpg" width="65" height="73" />MVP Defensive Skill Group (LB, CB, FS)<br />
<strong>Marcus Mendoza</strong><br />
Marcus was key in shutting down the Lawndale offense, who was unable to move the ball on Saturday. Marcus was able to stop the Cardinals from running outside, and was putting constant pressure on their Quarterback. With Marcus leading the defense, the Lawndale offense was only able to collect 1 first down all afternoon.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3194" alt="MM_MitchelSanchez" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mm_mitchelsanchez.jpg" width="61" height="83" /> MVP Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Mitchell Sanchez</strong><br />
Mitchell continues to work hard each and every week, and makes it easy for the Cowboys to be able to move the ball on the ground. Mitchell continued to dominate his opponent each and every play, from the snap of the ball until the echo of the referee's whistle. Sanchez played hard and never took a play off.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3195" alt="MM_PaysonSmith" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mm_paysonsmith.jpg" width="64" height="81" />MVP Defensive Line<br />
<strong>Payson Smith</strong><br />
From the defensive line position, Payson proved to be too strong for the Lawndale Cardinals to block him. He made several plays in the backfield, and came up big with a Quarterback sack when the defense needed a critical stop.</p>
