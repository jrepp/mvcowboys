<p><strong>We want to celebrate our athletes for their performances during the week. We agree that football is a team sport and that it requires the efforts of everyone on the team. However, we still want to acknowledge some players for their individual contributions and efforts.   If you see them walking around, make sure you give them an extra pat on the back. </strong></p>

MVP - Defensive Line<br />
<strong>Jack Matranga</strong> <em> aka "Meat"</em><br />
"Meat" proved to be a challenge for the Lakewood offensive line. No matter where he lined up, Jack used his size and strength to his advantage in order to make tackles and play in the Lakewood backfield all day.</p>

MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Cooper Hahn </strong><br />
In his first year, Cooper is consistently making strides and is quickly gaining in confidence. He's quickly becoming a dominate force on the offensive line and helps create huge running lanes to run through.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3422 alignright" alt="TM_WyatBrady" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tm_wyatbrady.jpg" width="75" height="99" /><br />
MVP - Defensive Skill Group (LB, FS, CB)<br />
<strong>Wyatt Brady</strong><br />
One of the smallest players on the field, came up with some of the biggest plays when his team needed them the most. What Wyatt lacked in size, he made up with in heart and determination. He single-handedly stopped the best Lakewood player(s) from catching passes on his side of the field. This just might be the start of "Brady Island...."</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3423" alt="TM_TreyTolmaire" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tm_treytolmaire.jpg" width="75" height="99" /> MVP - Offensive Skill Group (QB, WR, RB)<br />
<strong>Trey Tolmaire</strong><br />
Trey demonstrated good vision, power, and speed as he ran through and around the Longhorn defense all day Saturday. With the help of his teammates, Trey found himself reaching the end zone, <em>not 1...not 2...not 3....but</em><strong> 4</strong> times on Saturday.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000080;">Mighty Mite</span></strong></h1>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3195" alt="MM_PaysonSmith" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mm_paysonsmith.jpg" width="75" height="99" />MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Payson Smith</strong><br />
Payson played extremely well during week 6, and was constantly blocking his defender until the whistle blew. When the Longhorns attempted to blitz extra defenders Payson ensured that none of them were able to get by him, while still delivering a clean snap to the QB.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3424" alt="MM_NoahRepp" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_noahrepp.jpg" width="75" height="99" />MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Noah Repp</strong><br />
Noah also has the difficult challenge of snapping the ball to the QB while still keeping the defenders out of the backfield. Fortunately for his team, Noah is a player that is growing before the coach's eyes. Each week that passes, brings an increase in Noah's confidence and his contributions to the team's success.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3335" alt="MM_NicholasJohnson" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_nicholasjohnson.jpg" width="75" height="99" /></p>
<p>MVP - Offensive Line<br />
<strong>Nicholas Johnson</strong><br />
Nicholas continues to excel each week, and gets better with each snap. With each practice and with each game<br />
Nicholas is becoming a dominate player that teams will need to account for as they prepare to play the Cowboys.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3425" alt="MM_EthanPierson" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mm_ethanpierson.jpg" width="75" height="99" />MVP - Defensive Line<br />
<strong>Ethan Pierson </strong><em> aka "Easy-E"</em><br />
Even though Ethan may not be the biggest player on the field, he plays this game with the biggest heart. Ethan plays hard and gives it 100% every time he is on the field. Lakewood had no choice but to double team the smallest player on the field, because one player alone could not stop him.</p>
