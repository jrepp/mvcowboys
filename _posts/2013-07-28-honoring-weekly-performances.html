<p><strong>We want to celebrate our athletes for their performances during the week. We agree that football is a team sport and that it requires the efforts of everyone on the team. However, we still want to acknowledge some players for their individual contributions and efforts.   If you see them walking around, make sure you give them an extra pat on the back. </strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Sean Smer</strong></span> - <em>MVP Offensive Skill Group (RB, QB, WR)</em><br />
Sean Smer led the Cowboy ground attack and proved to be difficult to tackle. Sean was key in running out the clock in the final quarter to seal the victory for the Cowboys</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Trey Tomaire</strong> <em>- MVP Defensive Skill Group (LB, FS, CB)</em><br />
Trey found himself constantly around the ball and stopped the Viking ball carrier before gaining ground. Trey's big hits set the tempo for the defensive unit, which held the Vikings when they needed it most.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Davonte Curtis</strong></span> - <em>MVP Defensive Line</em><br />
The youngest player on the field had some of the biggest impacts from the defensive line. Davonte single handedly, caused and recovered a fumble, after messing up the center's snap. Davonte was key in disrupting the exchange between the center and quarterback all game long.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3049 alignright" alt="week1_tm_ol_derekford" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/week1_tm_ol_derekford.jpg" width="75" height="83" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Derek Ford</span></strong>- <em>MVP Offensive Line</em><br />
Derek Ford was one of the reasons that the Cowboy ground game could not be stopped. When the cowboys needed to gain critical yardage, the coach knew to run behind Derek Ford. No matter how the Vikings blitzed him, Derek moved them out of his way.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ruben Lopez</strong></span> - <em>MVP Defensive Skill Group (LB, CB, FS)</em><br />
Ruben Lopez kept the Cowboys in the contest against the Vikings by playing lights out defense and making several touchdown saving tackles. He didn't take a play off and left everything he had on the game field.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3047 alignleft" alt="Week1_MM_OL_MitchellSanchez" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/week1_mm_ol_mitchellsanchez.jpg" width="75" height="82" /><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Mitchell Sanchez</strong></span> <em>- MVP Offensive Line</em><br />
The Cowboys were able to run the ball with ease against the Vikings due in large part to Sanchez's blocking on the line. Regardless of the defensive front or the blitz package, Sanchez continued to dominate and open holes for his running backs.</p>
<p><a href="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/week1_mm_dl_darrellcurtis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3048" alt="Week1_MM_DL_DarrellCurtis" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/week1_mm_dl_darrellcurtis.jpg" width="75" height="82" /></a><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Darrell Curtis</strong></span> - <em>MVP Defensive Line</em><br />
Despite being diagnosed with an illness less than 24 hours before game time, Darrell managed to play through it. His efforts and aggressive play helped to slow down and at times completely stop the outside run game for the Santa Monica Vikings.</p>
<p><a href="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/week1_mm_rb_radynbadraun.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3049" alt="Week1_MM_RB_RadynBadraun" src="http://mvcowboysfootball.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/week1_mm_rb_radynbadraun.jpg" width="75" height="83" /></a><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Radyn Badraun</span></strong>- <em>MVP Offensive Skill Group (QB, RB, WR)</em><br />
Radyn consistently found running room throughout the Vikings defense the majority of game. Using a combination of speed, power, and agility, the Viking defenders found Radyn to be a very difficult player to tackle. Unfortunately Radyn suffered a serious leg injury which sidelined him the remainder of the game.</p>
