## **Online registration is now available for the 2013 Season**

Please use the following links to register. You must complete the online registration. You will have the option to pay online with a credit card or electronic check. We have added a few more payment options for you. You will also need to bring your child to one of the in person weigh-in registrations. Your child will not be placed on a team until the registration fee has been received and he has been weighed in.

Please make a log-in and password for yourself so you can edit your account if your personal information changes. All members of your family(Spouse, Grandma, Uncle, etc.) will fall under one account so please add them if you would like us to send emails and/or other information to them.

## **Registration**

If you are a returning player or cheerleader and remember your User Name and password please make sure to update all information including the proper division when you register so that we have accurate information regarding your child. If you are unable to retrieve your user name and password please follow the directions to register without that or you can ask the system to send your user information to the e-mail address of record.

**REGISTRATION DATES & LOCATIONS:**

Registration is being accepted through the online registration link by clicking on the links above or mailing in the registration form to our PO Box. If you choose to pay by mailing in a check you must have the envelope postmarked the day you register. Failure to send payment will result in a deletion of your registration.  
Please indicate the Division that you believe your child will be playing. The Weight and Age Table below will show you where your child qualifies based upon his age as of 7-31-2013 and his weight. The official weight check will be on "Certification Day" at a date TBD; however, we do require all athletes to have their weight checked at an in person registration prior to placement on a team. We will have another cursory weight check on Physical's Day. If your child is more than 10% away from the maximum weight the President may talk to you to discuss options and any potential need to switch Divisions if and only if there is room on another team. Your child must be be within these weight limits in shorts and t-shirt in order to continue to participate with their team after Certification Day. Please make your Division choice carefully. If you request a Division and then later change your mind due to being overweight and the team you request to be changed to is full you will not be switched even though you may have registered earlier than someone on that team. We do not offer refunds for not making weight.
