To our Cowboy Family,

I am pleased to announce that the Mission Viejo Cowboys are returning to
their roots, and have elected to return to the Orange Count Junior All
American Football league (OCJAAF) for the 2015 season.

Over the past few weeks we met with the leaders of the Pacific Coast
Conference (PCC), (OCJAAF), and Rancho Santa Margarita Pop Warner. After
spending several hours with each, and conducting a Q&A session, we
believe that OCJAAF will afford the Organization the best opportunity to
continue to grow.

Under the direction of OCJAAF our coaches will be able to continue to
help prepare your child for the next level of competition, while
instilling in them the values that the Mission Viejo Cowboys hold in
high regard.

In the next few days, we will be publishing a comparison report that we
will compile outlining the differences between each of the leagues. This
will be made available to help you make an informed decision about where
you decide to call home for the upcoming season. I would like to take
the opportunity to outline some of the key benefits that will be
realized as a result of this move:

1.  Increased minimum play time for kids

    a.  Lower levels required to play entire game quarters instead of a
        defined number of plays

2.  Fewer volunteers required for games from each team.

3.  More local away games.

4.  Less responsibility from Coaching staff beyond their game

    a.  Our Coaches are only there to coach and manage their games.

5.  Cheer competition geared towards preparing them for High School

We want to make sure we are setting the correct foundation for long term
growth, and do not wish to rush through the process. Therefore, we
appreciate your continued patience as we work through these decisions.

Please stay tuned for details about our early registration discounts
coming in the next few days!

Feel free to contact me with any questions that you may have.

MV Prez,
