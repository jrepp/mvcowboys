## A Letter from the President

Hello Everyone,
 
I am sure that some of you are aware of the recent changes that have taken place within the Cowboy Organization. I am honored to have been elected as President, and we have a new Executive Board in place. We are actively working to get ready for the upcoming season. As more details unfold we will do our absolute best make sure that everyone is informed as quickly as possible. In the meantime, let me thank you in advance for your patience during this transitional period. As we move towards the new season, we want to make sure you feel you have a platform to voice your concerns and/ or suggestions. Feel free to email me directly, or send in your comments anonymous via our website by [clicking here](http://mvcowboysfootball.com/contact-us/).
 
Concerning our Banquet, we are still ironing out the details, but plan to have the event between Feb and March. When the final date is determined, we will make sure that we are sensitive to everyones schedule to avoid any conflicts. We are also working on setting a date to collect the football gear, so stay tuned for that. The initial equipment return may take place as soon as this Saturday morning, so please start gathering your gear together. A notice will be sent out by the end of the week confirming the turn in details.
 
Let me know if you have any questions, as feel free to call my cell if youd like to chat.
 
 
 
Thank you,
Dereck Curtis
