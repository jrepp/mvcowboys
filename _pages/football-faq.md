### **When does the season start and how long does it last?**

We begin with conditioning during Spirit Week, which usually starts the last week in July. The regular game season begins in September and can go through December, depending on playoffs and tournaments the teams engage in. Playoffs for the PCC are based on the team’s actual performance record during the regular season. Most teams engage in scrimmages beginning in early August, in place of practice times.

### **When and where are Practices Held?**

Practices vary based on when school is in session. The Cowboys place a high value on scholastics, so we practice less often during the academic year than during the summer to allow ample time for school. The Cowboys utilize three locations in Mission Viejo for our practices: Mission High School, La Paz Middle School and Newhart Middle School.

**-- Spirit Week**  
Spirit Week actually spans two weeks, and kicks off our football season in Late July. Dates will be announced shortly, but most teams practice Monday – Friday for 2 hours a day. (Typically 5 – 7 p.m.)

**-- In Season Practices**  
We believe in rigorously preparing our football players. Throughout the summer, between Spirit Week and the School year, you can anticipate practicing 5 days a week for 2 hours a day. The specific dates and times are determined by each team, but generally teams practice Monday – Friday from 5-7 p.m., unless there is a scrimmage.

**-- In School Practices**  
We understand the value of education and therefore during the Academic School year, practice is reduced to only 3 days a week for two hours a day (less time for Flag).

### **Why do the Cowboys practice so much?**

The Communities around us have always had a lot of respect for the Cowboy organization and the Coaches that lead our youth. Even the other local football organizations readily agree that the Cowboys are fortunate enough to field some of the best coaches in our area. The Cowboy teams are always known to be fierce competitors on the field and properly behaved young adults off the field. Discipline and respect for authority are some of the core principals that our teams are founded upon. In order to achieve the high standards of discipline, respect, leadership and honor, and to have the life changing impact that we aim to have, it does take time for our coaches to properly mold their players. Fortunately, we have dedicated coaches that are willing to spend the time required no matter how long that may be.

### **Do the Cowboys hold tryouts or drafts?**

The Cowboys are all inclusive – if your child wants to play football, there is no tryout or elimination process. You have the opportunity to meet individually with the coaching staff and discuss their coaching philosophy, approach and training. Some chapters will have all their players within a age bracket practicing together during the first few days of the season so they can be evaluated by a common coaching staff. At the end of the process the players are then divided into an "A" or "B" team, with the "A" team designation going to the team with the "better" athletes. While this does give the chapter an opportunity to set one team up for a successful season, it does so at the expense of the members of the "B" team. We believe that all of our players have the right and opportunity to be a part of the "A" team, and we do not separate them based on their current abilities. We understand that every "B" player is just a diamond in the rough, who when surrounded by experienced players, will also learn how to reach their potential. We also want to avoid giving an athlete the impression of them not being good enough, and thus regulated to play on the "B" squad. We don't have an "A" or "B" team, but we have one "C" team......the "Cowboys" team!

### **What are the Required Documents I must provide before my child can participate?**

- MV Cowboys Code of Conduct
- PCC Code of Conduct
- Online or Paper Registration
- Original Birth Certificate/ Passport
- Physical Evaluation Form
- Proof of Address – Utility Bill, House Deed, Rental Agreement, etc.

### **What other costs should I expect? What equipment do I need to purchase?**

We believe in full disclosure on all associated costs so that parents know what to expect before the season starts, which is unique and unlike what you will get from other Youth Football organizations. Here are the costs that most families incur, in addition to the registration and mandatory raffle:

- Cleats
- Jock Strap
- Team Slush Fund

Basically, that’s all. Many families opt to buy items like additional mouth guards, long sleeved shirts, beanies, etc. Some families opt to buy their own pads and helmets, but none of these purchases are required and the Cowboys provide nearly everything the players need. Items included with registration are listed on the [Football page](http://wp.me/P2Koar-2l/#equipment).

### **Are there any weight or age restrictions I should be aware of?**

Yes, please take note of the following restrictions that are currently being enforced:

\* The six (6) year old in the Tiny Mite division for football only must weigh a MINIMUM of 60 pounds to play in that division..

\* The seven (7) year old in the Mighty Mite division for football only must weigh a MINIMUM of 60 pounds to play in that division. It is in the discretion of the City/Association to permit a 7 year old in the Mighty Mite division.

\*The fourteen (14) year old in the Midget division must be in 8th grade to play in that division.

### **What areas can I expect to travel to for games and tournaments?**

Our football players compete against other teams throughout Southern California during our regular season and playoffs. Generally speaking, for away games, we travel together as a Chapter. We travel throughout Orange County, Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire for away games. We  believe that our athletes can compete with the best out there, no matter where they may reside. Therefore, we embrace the opportunity to travel to [other neighboring cities](http://mvcowboysfootball.com/1920/07/27/who-do-we-compete-against/ "Who do we compete against?")showing how hard our athletes work and how competitive their spirits are.

We are proud of the fact that our Home Games all take place at either Mission High School or Laguna Beach High School. Our alliance to the Mission High School Diablo’s is strong, which is demonstrated by our joint participation in one another’s camps, practices and games.

Some of our teams opt to travel to tournaments in various locations. In past seasons, for example, some of our teams participated in a tournament in Las Vegas, NV. There are other tournaments throughout California, Nevada, Texas, Florida, etc. that teams may elect to participate in with Board and PCC approval. Typically, teams discuss these options and jointly determine whether or not to participate. The history of the Cowboys is well known through Southern California because of our willingness to travel and become"...._the greatest show on the road!_".

### **If my child doesn't like it, can we get a refund?**

Unfortunately we do have a no refund policy. There are associated costs that the Chapter incurs in order to operate the program and make it available to our youth. We appreciate your child wanting to participate in our program, and we intend to make it an enjoyable experience for them.

### **What is expected of Parents and Volunteers?**

The Cowboys rely entirely on its volunteers – from our Board of Directors to our Coaches and Staff. We are a parent run organization. Parents and guardians are expected to contribute volunteer hours for various positions available throughout the season. Individual Teams also conduct non-mandatory fundraising throughout the year, and participation will vary based on team. The success of the Chapter is based on the strength of our Volunteers.

Parents are expected to make sure their players arrive on time to all practices and games, and actively participate in our Cowboy Family.

### **Is it okay to plan vacation during the season?**

We really discourage families from taking vacations during the football season. There is a lot of training that the players need to go through to make sure they are ready for their 1st game of the season. Each day that the athlete misses only further delays them from being properly being prepared. If vacation plans cannot be avoided during the season, please discuss them with your Head Coach as early as possible.

### **Are there any football Camps Available?**

The Cowboys host and participate in multiple camps throughout the year. Our Premier Camp – The Cowboys Combine – is a week-long annual camp that occurs at the end of May or early June. During the Cowboys Combine, players learn the basic fundamentals of football, then showcase their talent on Saturday. We team with the Mission High Diablo’s football team during the Combine, and our young players get to work with them one-on-one in active drills.

There are other camps offered by PCC that players can optionally participate in, as well. Please check our [Camp page](http://wp.me/P2Koar-w), regularly to see the most up-to-date camp information.

### **How Qualified are your Coaches?**

All of our coaches engage in a rigorous evaluation and selection process. Their individual qualifications are evaluated by the Executive Board and direct feedback from parents is taken into consideration. In addition, all coaches are required to participate in Mandatory Coaching Clinics. All of our coaches are on our Board of Directors and participate in Board Meetings. Moreover, there is a specific Board Position – Athletic Director– whose sole purpose is to advocate for any issues that may arise during the season. The Cowboys take coaching very seriously and hold our coaches to the highest standards. We believe our Coaches are unmatched in their capabilities, talent and sportsmanship. You need only look to our records to see this.

Unlike other local Youth Football programs, every Coach and Board Member is required to pass a background check (LiveScan) and have an active First Aid Certification. In addition to participating in the [USA Football's Coach Education Program](http://usafootball.com), they are held to the rigorous standards in the Coach's Code of Conduct.

### **How do the Cowboys compare to other organizations?**

We believe that we are the premier organization in the area. Take a look at the reasons for [becoming a Cowboy](http://wp.me/s2Koar-336)to judge for yourself!

### **Where can I read about the League Rules?**

You can review the current Rule Book [here](http://www.pccfootballcheer.com/miscellaneous/doc_viewer.cfm?fileId=0C818E53-0847-4DAE-9B9D01AA8A20378F "here"). Every year, each chapter provides feedback and input into the PCC rule book. The rules are re-evaluated in April, and changes/corrections/ additions and deletions are made at that time.

### **Why doesn't everyone play for the Cowboys?**

Honestly, that is the _ **one** _question we don't know the answer to!
