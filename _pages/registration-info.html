We have added a few more payment options for you. You will also need to bring your child to one of the in person weigh-in registrations. Your child will not be placed on a team until the registration fee has been received and he has been weighed in.</p>

<p>Registration is being accepted through the online registration link by clicking on the links above or mailing in the registration form to our PO Box. If you choose to pay by mailing in a check you must have the envelope postmarked the day you register. Failure to send payment will result in a deletion of your registration.<br />
Please indicate the Division that you believe your child will be playing. The Weight and Age Table below will show you where your child qualifies based upon his age as of 7-31-2013 and his weight. The official weight check will be on "Certification Day" at a date TBD; however, we do require all athletes to have their weight checked at an in person registration prior to placement on a team. We will have another cursory weight check on Physical's Day. If your child is more than 10% away from the maximum weight the President may talk to you to discuss options and any potential need to switch Divisions if and only if there is room on another team. Your child must be be within these weight limits in shorts and t-shirt in order to continue to participate with their team after Certification Day. Please make your Division choice carefully. If you request a Division and then later change your mind due to being overweight and the team you request to be changed to is full you will not be switched even though you may have registered earlier than someone on that team. We do not offer refunds for not making weight.</p>
