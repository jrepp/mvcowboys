<p>The Mission Viejo Cowboys have a strong heritage, and is the premier Youth Football and Cheer Organization in South Orange County. Established in February 1982, we are entering our 31st year as an organization! The Cowboys are part of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) and allow players ages 5 – 14 to participate on our teams. Our teams are based on age, with League Age cutoff on July 31st of that playing year. We are the ONLY area youth football and cheerleading organization that exclusively serves the parents and children of Southern Orange County.</p>
<p>Last season, we had over 250 children participate in our youth football and cheerleading organization. We believe in the development of our players through participation in practices and games. Our coaches provide age appropriate instruction in the basics of the game of football, delivered in a manner that builds our players self confidence, creates a safe and fun atmosphere, and teaches the important life skills of teamwork, cooperation, and self discipline. We believe in investing in the safety of our youth and we work to provide the best possible equipment and facilities for our participants.</p>
